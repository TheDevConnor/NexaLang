My name is Sabian aka Sabe or sup0088. I am 14 and I have been coding for 4 years.
I started back in summer of 2020 when I broke my ps4 and I had an old laptop that I accidentally installed a couple viruses on.
When my dad showed me this program called Small Basic and I fell in love with it instantly I made very basic text based games but I was doing it for days.
But at some point I wanted to release my games but I figured out that small basic doesn't have a very good sharing network so I had to go hunting.
I went through a lot of programming language and I found out that I wasn't a fan of using engines like Godot and Unity so I started doing more with programming languages.
You may ask do I regret doing more with programming language? Would I ever go back. Well the answer is no. I have learned a lot than when I was using game engines and programming
making things from scratch is far more fun in my opinion.

# Why am I making Nexa
I am making Nexa because I want a language kind of like rust and multiple languages that I have used. You may ask why not use rust? Well I want a language that's less huge and that takes up
a lot of space, one that doesn't take a long time to compile one of rust big problems, a language that gives you more control and you don't have to fight with the barrow checker,
a language with simple syntax and little keywords Rust has 53 keywords while Nexa has only 23. That may not bother you but personally that makes it a little bit bloated in my opinion and I am 
not really a fan of that. Agree to disagree.
Also Nexa has syntax that I personally want in a language and syntax features from other languages that I really like.
